Notes while checking acceptability of model-based SRL tags.

srl_check.csv ahas a column "is_bad" which is True if the SRl labels are:
- incorrectly labeled, or
- important arguments are missing
but not if:
- there could be a more precise labeling or splitting of arguments into more precisely labeled arguments
- unimportant arguments are missing (those not essential for understanding the meaning of the utterance)

For example, the following
[ARG1: he] [V: 's] drinking water with his trunk .
is incorrect, because it is missing an important argument without which the meaning would be incomplete.

Are these correct?

I 'm sure she ate before [ARG0: she] [V: went] [ARG4: to work] .
[V: let] [ARG1: 's fix the straps huh] ?
[ARG0: you] [V: have] [ARG1: bells] [ARGM-LOC: on] [ARGM-LOC: in that picture] ?
if [ARG1: you] [V: get] [ARG2: angry] and start crying like if you wanna do something like pull my thing you just pick it up and it accidentally tears .
does this make a noise [ARGM-TMP: when] [ARG0: you] [V: pour] [ARG1: it] ?
[ARG1: who] [V: 's] [ARG2: baby] is the lil chick ?
[ARG2: over there] [ARG2: where] [ARG1: all your books] [V: are] ?
do you want to find [ARG0: a word] [R-ARG0: that] [V: has] [ARG1: the letter j in it] .
[ARG1: what] [V: 's] [ARG2: in his hand] ?
you know [ARG1: another thing that we did] [R-ARG1: that] [V: was] [ARG2: fun]
[ARGM-DIS: okay] [V: want] [ARG1: me to pitch] .
well I guess [ARG0: we] [ARGM-MOD: 'll] [V: find] out .

Errors involving [NAME]:

[ARG2: where] [V: 's] [ARG1: the big truck [NAME]] .
[ARGM-TMP: one day] [ARG0: my mother] [V: took] [ARG1: me] and [NAME] [ARG2: to the circus] .
[ARG2: where] [V: 's] [NAME] .
[ARG0: who] [V: gave] [ARG1: it] [ARG2: to you] [ARGM-TMP: before [NAME]] ?
[ARG0: okay] [NAME] [ARGM-MOD: will] [V: get] [ARG4: you] [ARG1: green olives] .
what [V: 's] [NAME] [ARG2: like] ?
[ARGM-CAU: why] did [NAME] [V: become] [ARG2: angry] [ARGM-ADV: though] ?
[NAME] 's at home [ARG1: he] [V: 's] [ARG2: with] [NAME] ?
was [ARG1: she] willing to [V: marry] [NAME] ?

Interesting successes:

[ARG0: very quiet] did [ARGM-NEG: n't] [V: say] [ARG1: much of anything] .
[ARGM-MOD: should] [ARG0: he] [V: go] [ARG1: bye bye] [ARGM-ADV: too] .
can you show me [ARG0: the girl] [V: shows] [ARG1: the dog] [ARG2: to the cat] ?
I do n't know [ARG0: who] 's [V: driving] [ARGM-DIS: honey] .

Verb identification errors:

would you like [V: spinach] salad girls ?
I do n't know is that [ARG1: all] [R-ARG0: that] 's [V: left] remember some broke last time when we were playing with them .
do [ARG0: you] like [V: babysitting] ?
[ARG1: a little turtle] [V: named] [ARG2: Squirt]

noun conjunctions:

[ARG1: the daddies and mommies] [ARGM-MOD: will] [V: sit] [ARG2: on that bench] ?
[ARGM-TMP: one day] [ARG0: my mother] [V: took] [ARG1: me] and [NAME] [ARG2: to the circus] .
this is May twenty five and [ARG0: [NAME] and I] are [V: reading] [ARG1: looking at a Creative Playthings catalogue] .
the [PLACE] children 's museum while [ARG0: [NAME] and [NAME]] [V: went] [ARG4: to the movies] ?
[ARG0: they] loved to [V: play] [ARG1: tag and algae] [ARGM-LOC: in the middle] [ARGM-TMP: before school started] .

Problems with CHILDES or sentence segmentation tool (e.g no utterance boundaries):

[ARGM-DIS: no] [ARG1: it] [V: 's] [ARG2: different meet from what we eat] ?
I 'm gon na take you [V: listen] I 'll take you to the bed+room and talk to you too
do n't say [ARGM-DIS: hi] [V: say] [ARG1: bye] .
[ARG1: those] [V: are] [ARGM-DIS: um] [ARG2: that 's an opossum] ?
this is May twenty five and [ARG0: [NAME] and I] are [V: reading] [ARG1: looking at a Creative Playthings catalogue] .
[ARG0: Gita] have to [V: say] [ARG3: about it] !
[ARG1: what] [ARG1: what] [V: happen] .
and then [ARG0: we] [V: chug] [ARG1: chug] stop and play .
[ARGM-DIS: now] put that in this hole [ARGM-TMP: now] [V: push] .
[NAME] [V: said] [NAME] [ARGM-DIR: into the trash bucket
there [V: 's] [ARG1: the cake] [ARGM-LOC: in the bakery window] .

Comparing human-based 2008 vs model-based (AllenNLP) SRL accuracy
Philip Huebner
Feb 13, 2020
###############################################

The number of model-based SRL utterances that are also in the 2008 human SRL data is 5,500.
Of those 5,500, 72% have identical labels.
This is a worst-case scenario, because any label sequences that are only incorrect at one position, are counted as incorrect.
For example, the following are label sequences from the model, and humans, respectively:
you may put it away if you like .   O      O O O O O B-ARG0 B-V O
you may put it away if you like .   B-ARG0 O O O O O O      B-V O
It seems the model is actually "more correct", because it has labeled the correct "you".
More examples of this:
do          n't         you         think       you         have        enough      ?
O           O           O           O           B-ARG0      B-V         B-ARG1      O
O           O           B-ARG0      O           O           B-V         B-ARG1      O
I       just    took    a       nap     before  I       came    .
O       O       O       O       O       O       B-ARG1  B-V     O
B-ARG1  O       O       O       O       O       O       B-V     O
what        does        she         look        like        when        she         puts        this        on          ?
O           O           O           O           O           B-ARGM-TMP  B-ARG0      B-V         B-ARG1      B-ARG2      O
O           O           B-ARG0      O           O           O           O           B-V         B-ARG1      O           O

Cases where the model-based annotation is more "complete":
go see the circus next year .   O B-V B-ARG1 I-ARG1 B-ARGM-TMP I-ARGM-TMP O
go see the circus next year .   O B-V B-ARG1 I-ARG1 O          O          O
I           like        a           baby        that        works       .
O           O           B-ARG0      I-ARG0      B-R-ARG0    B-V         O
O           O           B-ARG0      I-ARG0      O           B-V         O

Cases in which the model and human disagree, but both are acceptable:
shall       I           put         this        back        there       ?

now         go          back        this        way         .

B-ARG1      B-ARGM-MOD  B-V         B-ARG4      O

B-ARG0      B-V         B-ARG1      B-ARGM-DIR  B-ARGM-TMP  I-ARGM-TMP  I-ARGM-TMP  O
and         then        what        do          you         do          ?
O           O           B-ARG1      O           B-ARG0      B-V         O

More severe mismatches, where the model incorrectly labels core arguments:
